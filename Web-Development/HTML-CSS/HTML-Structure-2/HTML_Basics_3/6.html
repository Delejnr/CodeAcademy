<!--Head of the table
Here's the table we made earlier. It's okay, but it just looks like we have a list of famous
 Hollywood people (monsters?) and their birth years. To make our table look a little more like a table, we'll use the <thead> and <tbody> tags. 
	 These go within the <table> tag and stand for table head and table body, respectively.

The <head> HTML tag contains information about a web page (e.g. its title) and the <body> tag contains the contents of the web page. 
	In the same way, the <thead> tag can be thought of as containing information about a table and the <tbody> tag containing the actual tabular data.

Instructions
Since everything we currently have is just tabular data, put everything we have in our table so far between a set of <tbody></tbody> tags.
 We'll add the table head next!-->
