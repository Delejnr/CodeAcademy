<!--Introduction
Our HTML journey has been progressing very nicely. We've covered:

how to set up the skeleton of an HTML file
headings, paragraphs, images and links
font colors, sizes, and types
background colors, aligning text, bolding and italic izing font
In this course, we'll cover some important structural aspects of HTML: <table>s, <div>s, and <span>s!

Instructions
To get warmed up:

Make the heading have the font family Arial.
Add an image!
Add a second image which is clickable and links to a site. (Check the Hint if you don't remember how to do this.)-->
