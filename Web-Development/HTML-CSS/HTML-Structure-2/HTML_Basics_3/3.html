<!--Rows of information
A table is just a bunch of information arranged in rows and columns.

We use the <tr> tag to create a table row. We'll learn how to create columns shortly, and everything will start to come together. 
	(You don't really create columns in <table>s: instead, you tell each row how many cells to have, and that determines your number of columns).

Instructions
We'll get to the details of table cells in a minute. In the meantime, we've added a set of <tr></tr> tags to the table on line 9, creating a table row.

Add two more rows to the table on line 11 and line 12.-->
