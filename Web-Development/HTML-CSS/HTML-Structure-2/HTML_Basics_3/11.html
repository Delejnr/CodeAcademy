<!-- 'Div'ide and conquer One of the most versatile structure tags available to you
is the <div></div> tag. Short for "division," <div> allows you to divide your
page into containers (that is, different pieces). This will come in handy when
you begin learning CSS in the next unit: you'll be able to style different parts
of your website individually!

Check out the Result tab. You should see three blocks: one red, one blue, and
one green. Each one is its own <div> container.

Instructions Now you try! On line 10, create your own <div> and give it the
background-color: yellow. Use the width and height syntax we've used for the
other <div>s as a guide.
