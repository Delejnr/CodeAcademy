<!-- Recap Great work! In addition to what you've already learned, you now know how to:

Divide up your webpage for easy styling with <div> tags Select pieces of text and change their
properties using <span> tags In the next course, we'll see how we can take much of the styling we've
been doing—such as controlling font family, font color, and text alignment—and put it in its own
separate file. By doing that, we can use tags like <div> and <span> to impart style to our pages
without writing style="color:red" every single time!

Instructions We've given you a taste of how <span> can be powered by CSS in the editor. Check it out
on the Result tab. Cool, huh?
