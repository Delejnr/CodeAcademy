<!-- tyle that head!
Your table is starting to look great, but it's still a little bland. 
We've gone ahead and added some styling to the table to make it a bit easier to read. It's your job to add the finishing touches!

Feel free to play around with any of the style attributes we added; you'll learn much more about these things later during the CSS courses.

If you want to add more than one style, you just separate your styles with a semicolon, like so:

<th style="font-size:12px; color:red"></th>
Instructions
Make the "Famous Monster" and "Birth Year" labels emphasized (i.e. make them italicized).
Make the "Famous Monsters by Birth Year" title red. -->
