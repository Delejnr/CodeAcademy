<!-- Table Heads
We have just added a <thead> tag above the <tbody>.
It will hold the heading for each column.

You add text to a <thead> similar to a <tbody>, like this:

<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Name
    </th>
    <th>
      Favorite Color
    </th>
  </tr>
</thead>
First we have an opening <thead> tag for the table head.
Then we have an opening <tr> tag for the row. (to start the row)
After that, a <th></th> cell for the Name column heading. Notice that we use <th></th> for the table heading cells instead of<td></td>.
Then another <th></th> cell for the Favorite Color column heading.
Finally, we close the row element with a closing </tr> tag, and close out the table heading element with a closing </thead> tag.
Instructions
We have already created the <thead></thead> element for you!

Inside the table heading element, add a single row using a <tr></tr> element.
Within this row, add two <th></th> cells with the values Famous Monster and Birth Year.
Check out the example above to see what the structure should look like. -->

                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
