<!--Adding a second column
It may not have seemed like much, but you just created a single-column table in the last exercise. Nice work!

Now take a look at what we have on our page. Notice in the first table row we now have two table data cells.

Adding a second table data cell has the effect of adding a second table column, although if you go to the Result view, 
it may look funny because only the first row has two cells. Let's fix that!

Instructions
Add a <td> tag to the second <tr> tag with the value 1897, like this: <td>1897</td>
Add a<td> tag to the third <tr> tag with the value of 1935
Check out the preview window. We now have a total of 2 columns and 3 rows, and each row has 2 cells.
Sweet! We now have a basic table. Go on to the next section to find out how to add a header and a title to our table.-->

            <tr>
                <td>Dracula</td>
                <td>1897</td>
