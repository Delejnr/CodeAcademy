<!--A single column
Look at the HTML now. Can you tell that there are still three rows? We've added a little more whitespace to make
it easier to deal with table columns and table data.

We've added a single <td> ("table data") cell to the first row, essentially creating a single column. 
	If you view the Result tab now, you'll see that we've drawn a border around it. it's not that impressive, 
	but don't worry: we're about to add more table data cells.

We're starting to add a lot of HTML elements now. Make sure to indent your tags as you nest them so you don't get confused!

Instructions
In the second row, add a table data (<td></td>) cell and type Two between the tags.
In the third row, add another cell with Three between the tags.
Go to the Result view. You can see that we have 1 column with 3 rows, and each row contains exactly one cell.-->
