<!--What are tables?
Tables are very useful. We use them to store tabular data so it is easy to read! When you want to present 
information neatly in a table with rows and columns—you guessed it—the <table> tag is what you need.

There are many tags associated with tables, but it all starts with the <table> tag, so let's add that first.

Instructions
Add an opening and closing set of <table> tags to the body of this HTML document.
Go to the Result view. You'll notice that nothing visible was added. That's because our table's not populated yet! We'll learn how to do that soon.
