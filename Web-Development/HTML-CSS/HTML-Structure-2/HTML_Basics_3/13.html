<!-- Spantastic While <div> allows you to divide your webpage up into pieces you can style individually,
<span> allows you to control styling for smaller parts of your page, such as text. For example, if
you always want the first word of your paragraphs to be red, you can wrap each first word in
<span></span> tags and make them red using CSS!

Instructions For now, we'll continue to use the style attribute to change colors. Wrap the word
"red" in the editor in <span></span> tags and give the <span> tag style="color:red". Notice how only
the word between the <span></span> tags changes color!
