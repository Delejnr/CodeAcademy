<!--Unordered lists
We just learned how to make ordered lists, but what if the order doesn't matter, what if we just want bullet points?

<h2>Taco Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Sour Cream</li>
</ul>
Does this look familiar?

First, we open our list with an unordered list <ul> tag
For each item we wish to add to the list, we use a list item tag <li> with text in between
We then tell the browser we are done with our list by calling our closing </ul> tag
Instructions
In your <body> tag, create an <h1> tag and put the text 'Some random thoughts' inside it.
Under your <h1> tag, create a paragraph using the <p> tag which describes the list you will make.
Finally, create an unordered list with the <ul> tag which contains a list of four random thoughts, each of which should be placed inside of an <li> tag-->
