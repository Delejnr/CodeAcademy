<!--Indentation is your friend
Now is a good time to quickly mention indentationâ€”that is, the amount each line is spaced in from the margin. You'll notice that when we place tags inside of other tags, we indent them more. This really helps make your code more readable!

Check out our indentation in the editor to the right. Try to follow this indentation style when you're writing HTML so you don't get confused.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
