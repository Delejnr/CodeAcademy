<!--Font color
What is awesome about the style attribute is that we use it a lot! And we can use it with many different tags, not just <p>. Let's now change the colors of our text in a heading.

To change the color of text, simply add the style attribute in the opening tag, then make the style equal to "color:blue" (or whatever color you like). For example:

<h2 style="color:red">
What if you want to change the color and the size of the text? Simple! Just add a semi-colon between each bit. For example:

<h2 style="color: green; font-size:12px">
A full list of available colors can be found here.

Note: do not type something like:

<h2 <h2 style="color: green; font-size:12px">
If you incorrectly nest your HTML tags like that, your code will not pass.

Instructions
Change the heading color to green and its size to 16px.
Change the color of the first paragraph to violet.
Change the color of the second paragraph to red and its font size to 10px.-->
