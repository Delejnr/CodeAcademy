<!--One more ordered list
We really think that ordered lists are excellent. Who doesn't love a bit of order? So let's do a bit more practice. If you forget what an ordered list looks like, feel free to look back at the previous section!

Instructions
In the body tag, create an <h3> tag with the text 'Most annoying TV celebrities'.
Make an ordered list with the <ol> tag of the top 3 TV celebrities you find not to your taste. Remember, these go between the list item tag <li>
Remember to close your ordered list with the </ol> tag
Under the list you made, make an <h2> tag with the text "Top three things I can do for Mother's Day."
Then make another ordered list of those things too!-->
