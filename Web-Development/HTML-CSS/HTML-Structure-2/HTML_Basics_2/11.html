<!--Recap
Awesome job! You've now got control of your webpage, including the color, size and type of your font. To recap, we use the style attribute in the opening tag, like so:

a. font-size: 14px
b. color: orange
c. font-family: Bodoni

<p style = "font-size:14px; color: orange; font-family: Bodoni">
It's important to know that you can use the style attribute for paragraphs, headings, and even links!

Instructions
For the paragraph on line 7, make the font have:

a. A size of 20px
b. A color of blue
c. A font-family of Arial-->
