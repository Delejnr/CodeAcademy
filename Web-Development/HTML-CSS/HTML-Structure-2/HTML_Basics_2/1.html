<!--Introduction
Let's continue learning more HTML. You've already covered a lot: how to set up <head> and <body> tags, how to make headings and paragraphs, and how to add images and links.

In this course, we'll take it to the next level:

a. Making ordered and unordered lists
b. Changing font size, color and type
c. Changing the background color
d. Aligning the text

Instructions
Let's get warmed up by adding a <title> in the <head>.
In the body, create a paragraph (using <p>). Write anything you like!-->
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>This is the title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	    <p>This is a para</p>
	</body>
</html>
