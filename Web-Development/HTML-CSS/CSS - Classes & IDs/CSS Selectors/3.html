<!-- One selector to rule them all
There's also a very special selector you can use to apply CSS styling to every element on the page: the * selector. For example, if you type

* {
    border: 2px solid black;
}
You'll create a two-pixel wide solid black border around every element on the HTML page.

Instructions
Go ahead and use the universal selector to put a 1px dashed #3A5FCD border around every element on the page. See how each element looks like it's in its own box on the page? This is part of the HTML/CSS "box model," which we'll cover in the next lesson. -->
