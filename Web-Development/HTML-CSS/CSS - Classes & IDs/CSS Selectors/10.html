<!-- Beyond HTML elements
HTML elements can be CSS selectors, but as we saw with the universal selector *, they're not the only selectors available.

There are two important selectors you can use in addition to the universal selector and HTML elements: classes and IDs.

Instructions
You'll see a class and an ID declared in the HTML tab. We'll get to the syntax for these in the next exerciseâ€”in the meantime, remove the comment (the leading /* and trailing */) from the CSS tab to see how they work! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"/>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h3 class="red">I'm an h3 header in the red class!</h3>
		<h3>I'm just a regular old h3 header.</h3>
		<p class="red">I'm a paragraph in the red class!</p>
		<p>I'm just a regular old paragraph.</p>
		<p id="rogue">I'm a rogue paragraph! I do what I want!</p>
	</body>
</html>
