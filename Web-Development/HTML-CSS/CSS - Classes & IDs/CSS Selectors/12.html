<!-- ID, please!
IDs, on the other hand, are great for when you have exactly one element that should receive a certain kind of styling.

IDs are assigned to HTML elements with the word id and an equals sign:

<div id="first"></div>
<div id="second"></div>
<p id="intro"></p>
IDs are identified in CSS with a pound sign (#):

#first {
    height: 50px;
}

#second {
    height: 100px;
}

#intro {
    color: #FF0000;
}
This allows you to apply style to a single instance of a selector, rather than all instances.

Instructions
Create any number of HTML elements you like and give one of them the ID "serious". On the CSS tab, set #serious to have a font-family of Courier and a color of #CC0000. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"/>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!--Add your HTML elements with the ID "serious" below!-->
		<div id="serious">
		    <h1>This is a serious header</h1>
		    <p>This is a serious para</p>
		</div>
		
	</body>
</html>

<!-- /*Define your CSS id #serious below!*/

#serious{
    font-family:Courier;
    color:#cc0000;
} -->
