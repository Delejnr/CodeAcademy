<!-- Branching
You can think of an HTML document as a tree: elements "branch out" from the main trunk (the <html></html> tags). The first two big branches are <head> and <body>, and branches multiply and become finer as you get to elements like <div>s, <table>s, and text (headers and paragraphs).

Instructions
We've sketched a potential family tree out for you in the editor (check the Result tab). When you think you've wrapped your mind around the HTML "tree," hit Save & Submit Code! -->
