<!-- Nth child
Well done! You can actually select any child of an element after the first child with the pseudo-class selector nth-child; you just add the child's number in parentheses after the pseudo-class selector. For example,

p:nth-child(2) {
    color: red;
}
Would turn every paragraph that is the second child of its parent element red.

The element that is the child goes before :nth-child; its parent element is the element that contains it.

Instructions
On the CSS tab:

Set the second paragraph to the font-family Tahoma.
Set the third paragraph to have the color #CC0000.
Set the fourth paragraph to have the background-color #00FF00.
Set the fifth paragraph to have the font-size 22px. -->
