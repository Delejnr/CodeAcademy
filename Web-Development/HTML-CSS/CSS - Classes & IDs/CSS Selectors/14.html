<!-- Even finer control
You've learned about class selectors. Now it's time to learn about pseudo-class selectors.

A pseudo-class selector is a way of accessing HTML items that aren't part of the document tree (remember the tree structure we talked about earlier?). For instance, it's very easy to see where a link is in the tree. But where would you find information about whether a link had been clicked on or not? It isn't there!

Pseudo-class selectors let us style these kinds of changes in our HTML document. For example, we saw we could change a link's text-decoration property to make it something other than blue and underlined. Using pseudo selectors, you can control the appearance of unvisited and visited linksâ€”even links the user is hovering over but hasn't clicked!

The CSS syntax for pseudo selectors is

selector:pseudo-class_selector {
    property: value;
}
It's just that little extra colon (:).

Instructions
Uncomment the pseudo-class selector in the CSS tab, then check out the Result to see what happens when you pass your cursor over the links! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"/>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
