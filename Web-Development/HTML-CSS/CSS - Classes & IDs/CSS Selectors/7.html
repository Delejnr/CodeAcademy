<!-- Swinging from branch to branch
All right! Now that you have an idea of how HTML documents are structured, it's time to see how good you are at navigating from branch to branch.

Instructions
We've added some links in the editor to the right. On the CSS tab, target ONLY the <a>s that are children of <li>s and

Set their text-decoration to none
Set their font-family to cursive
Don't change the link that's not part of the unordered list! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
