<!--  Rock Your Selectors
Great work! Selectors can be a bit tricky, but the more you use them, the more comfortable you'll become.

Instructions
Let's make sure you really know your stuff.

On the CSS tab:

Set all paragraph text to the hexadecimal color #00E5EE.
Set all paragraph text for paragraphs nested inside div tags to the hex color #CC0000. (What color will they turn if they've already been told in step #1 to be #00E5EE? See the Hint!)
Put a border with the hex color #3A5FCD around every HTML element. It can be solid, dotted, dashed, 2px, 3px, whatever you like!
