<!-- First child
Another useful pseudo-class selector is first-child. It's used to apply styling to only the elements that are the first children of their parents. For instance:

p:first-child {
    color: red;
}
Would make all paragraphs that are the first children of their parent elements red.

Instructions
On the CSS tab, set the first paragraph's font-family to cursive. -->
