<!-- You've done it!
Great job! You've created a map of people you know that's differentiated based on different CSS classes.

Feel free to go ahead and change any of the CSS you've used so far, including colors, borders, and border-radii. Make it your own!

If you're looking for a bonus challenge, try adding images and links to each <div> so your various circles look like (and link to) your friends, family, and foes!
