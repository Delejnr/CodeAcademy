<!--Emphasize words!
Aside from bolding words, we often want to italicize words for emphasis. (Hint, hint.)

Like bolding, we do not need to use the style attribute. Instead:

Identify the word or words you want to italicize.
Surround the word or words with the opening tag <em> and closing tag </em>.
Be humble and grateful for your newfound powers.
Instructions
On line 7, italicize the word 'that'.
On line 8, italicize the word 'so'.
Make sure you don't include the "!" between the <em></em> tags on line 7!-->
