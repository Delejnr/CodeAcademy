<!--Font size
Recall that <p> and </p> are opening and closing tags.

We can give tags more instructions by including attributes in the opening tag. An attribute is simply a characteristic or some description for the content in the element. 
You saw this with src in <img> and href in <a>.

Let's change the size of the text. How? We use the style attribute. We make it equal to font-size, followed by a colon, the size you want, and end it with px (short for "pixels").
 For example:

<p style="font-size: 12px">
Instructions
On line 7, make the text size 10px.
On line 8, make the text size 20px.
On line 9, make the text size 40px.
If you're having trouble with font sizes, reset your browser's zoom by pressing Cmd-0 or Ctrl-0.-->
