<!-- The importance of semicolons
As you start adding more and more property-value pairs for each CSS selector, it's important to remember to put a semicolon (;) at the end of each line.

The semicolon tells CSS that one property-value pair is over and it's time to move on to the next one. Without semicolons, it'll become confused and your page won't look right.

Also, don't forget: all property-value pairs for a selector are surrounded by curly braces ({}).

Instructions
The CSS in stylesheet.css is broken; some of the curly braces ({}) are out of whack and semicolons are missing. Your mission (should you choose to accept it): fix this CSS! -->
