<!-- If it's in, it's out!
We previously showed you how to do inline styling with HTML, like so:

<p style="color:red">Red font!</p>
This is a less awesome way to style your website for the reasons we just mentioned: you have to write the same code over and over, and if you want to make a big stylistic change to several elements, you have to change every single style tag. With a single CSS file, you only have to make the change in one place!

There are two ways to put CSS in one place. This first is to put your CSS between <style></style> tags, right in the same file as your HTML. These <style> tags go inside the <head></head> of your webpage; check out the example in the editor to the right. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			p {
				color: purple;
			}
		</style>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Check it out! I'm purple!</p>
	</body>
</html>
