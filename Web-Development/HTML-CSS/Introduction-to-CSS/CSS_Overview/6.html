<!-- PSA: Self-closing tags
This brings us to a quick (but noteworthy!) concept in HTML: the self-closing tag.

Because nothing ever goes between <link></link> tags, it's okay to use a single set of <>s to be the opening and closing tags. You do that like so:

<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="CSS file address"/>
You may have noticed us do something similar with the <img> tag:

<img src="web address"/>
Most tags are not self-closing, but we'll point out the self-closing ones to help save you time and typing.
