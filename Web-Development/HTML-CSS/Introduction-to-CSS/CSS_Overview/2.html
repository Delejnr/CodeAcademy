<!-- What CSS is
CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the appearance and formatting of your HTML.

A style sheet is a file that describes how an HTML file should look. That's it!

We say these style sheets are cascading because the sheets can apply formatting when more than one style applies. For instance, if you say all paragraphs should have blue font, but you specifically single out one paragraph to have red font, CSS can do that! (We'll talk more about cascading in section four.)

Instructions
Click on stylesheet.css (it's that tab near the top of your screen, next to index.html). We've put in the CSS to make the paragraph's text red, but you need to add the CSS that will make the text between <span></span> tags blue. Fill it in and click Save & Submit Code! -->

		<p>I'm a paragraph written in red font, but one of my words is <span>blue</span>!</p>
