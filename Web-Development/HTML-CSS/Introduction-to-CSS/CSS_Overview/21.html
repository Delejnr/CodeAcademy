<!-- Links and text decoration
Links have a lot of the same properties as regular text: you can change their font, color, size, and so on.

But links also have a property, text-decoration, that you can change to give your links a little more custom flair. You're probably used to seeing links that are blue and underlined, right? Well, that's not the way it has to be!

Instructions
In the stylesheet.css tab, give your a selector a color of #cc0000 and a text-decoration of none. Check out how the link changes in the Result tab! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"/>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>The below link goes to Google!</p>
		<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
	</body>
</html>

    color:#cc0000;
    text-decoration:none;
