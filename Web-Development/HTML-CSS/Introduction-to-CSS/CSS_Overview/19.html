<!-- Background color, height, and width
Remember our friend <div>, and how we used it to make those multi-colored blocks? Time for you to build your own blocks! (Well, block. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.)

There are three properties you'll need to set values for:

background-color, which you set to a color or hex value
height, which you set to a value in pixels
width, which is also measured in pixels
These exercises will give you a brief overview of the different HTML elements you can select and what some of their property-value pairs are (like the new ones we mention above). We'll cover HTML element selection more in the next course!

Instructions
In the stylesheet.css tab:

Set the background-color to #cc0000, like this: background-color: #cc0000;
Set the height to 100px, like this: height: 100px;
Set the width to 100px, as well.
