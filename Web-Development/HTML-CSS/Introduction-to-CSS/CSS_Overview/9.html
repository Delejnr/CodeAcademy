<!-- Many selectors, many properties
Good work! They say that practice makes perfect, so let's do a couple more. (We'll talk even more about selectors in the next course.)

Instructions
Make all the h3 headings red.
Set all the paragraphs to the Courier font-family. (Make sure to capitalize "Courier" as shown!)
The second paragraph contains text between <span></span> tags. Set the background-color of that <span> to 'yellow'. (See the Hint for help!) -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"/>
		<title>I Know Kung Fu (er, CSS)</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div>
			<h3>What's CSS for?</h3>
			<p>CSS is for styling HTML pages!</p>
			<h3>Why use it?</h3>
			<p>It makes webpages look <span>really rad</span>.</p>
			<h3>What do I think of it?</h3>
			<p>It's awesome!</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- Color commentary
Great! You're really getting the hang of this.

While it's important to get all your syntax down correctly, it's also a good idea to write comments as you go along. Good comments will help remind you why you did something a certain way (or will help someone else out if they're reading your code without you there to explain it).

As you've seen, HTML comments look like this: -->

<!--I'm a comment!-->
<!-- CSS comments, on the other hand, look like this:

/*I'm a comment!*/
Remember: the computer doesn't look at comments when figuring out what your HTML and CSS should do, but writing good comments is a good habit you want to pick up!

Instructions
See the CSS we've added for the p selector in stylesheet.css? Comment it out! (That is, put /* before the p in that tab and */ after the closing }. -->

Check yourself before you wreck yourself
You've learned a lot in just a few short lessons. We're impressed! Let's quickly review to make sure you really know your stuff.

Instructions
Add a <link> to stylesheet.css between your <head></head> tags.
Change the <h1> header's font-family to Verdana. (Make sure Verdana is capitalized as shown!)
Change the <h3> header's font-family to Courier. (Make sure Courier is capitalized as shown!)
Make the paragraph text color purple.
Add a /* CSS comment */ to the CSS tab! It can say anything you like. (Remember: HTML comments and CSS comments are written differently.) -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<!--Add your link tag here!-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css"
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Change me to Verdana.</h1>
		<h3>Change me to Courier.</h3>
		<p>Make me purple!</p>
	</body>
