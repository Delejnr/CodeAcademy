<!-- Link it up!
But there's an even better way.

You know you should write your CSS in a totally separate file. But how do you make sure your HTML file can see that CSS information?

You do this by putting a <link> tag (as you saw in the first exercise of this course) between the <head>...</head> tags of your HTML page. Your <link> tag needs three attributes:

A type attribute that should always be equal to "text/css"
A rel attribute that should always be equal to "stylesheet"
A href attribute that should point to the web address of your CSS file
In the editor to the right, you'll see two files: index.html and stylesheet.css.

Instructions
Insert a <link> to stylesheet.css in index.html. Check the Hint if you need help! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"/>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>I want to be SIZE 44 font!</p>
	</body>
</html>
