<!-- One selector, many properties
Great work!

Another cool advantage of CSS is that you can set many properties for one selector. For instance, if you want to set a paragraph's font, font color, and font size, you can simply write:

p {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
Remember: end each property-value pair with a semicolon!

Please note: If you have adjusted your browser's zoom, tests involving font-size and height will not work correctly. To remedy this, please type Command+0 or Ctrl+0 to reset your view.

Instructions
Underneath your color: green property-value pair (but before the final }!), set the font-family to Garamond and the font-size to 24px. -->
