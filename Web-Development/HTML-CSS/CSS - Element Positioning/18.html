<!-- Absolute positioning
The first type of positioning is absolute positioning. When an element is set to position: absolute, it's then positioned in relation to the first parent element it has that doesn't have position: static. If there's no such element, the element with position: absolute gets positioned relative to <html>.

To show you how this works, we've set the #outer div to have absolute positioning. This means that when you position the #inner div, it will be relative to #outer. (If #outer had the default positioning of static, then #inner would get positioned relative to the entire HTML document.)

Instructions
Try it out: set #inner's position to absolute and give it a margin-left of 20px.
