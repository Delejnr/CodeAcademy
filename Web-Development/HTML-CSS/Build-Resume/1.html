<!-- What you'll be building
You'll be using your CSS skills to style an eye-catching resume. You'll need to call on your knowledge of CSS selectors, classes/IDs, margins, padding, borders, and positioning to make everything look exactly the way you want it to.

That said, this project will be relatively hands-off. We've put a demo resume in the editor (check the Result tab) for you to use as a template, but you should feel free to style your resume the way you'd like.
