On lines 12 through 19, you can see a function named authorize.

    This function will check whether a submitted password is equal to 'swordfish'. If it is, then this.state.authorized will become true.

    You need authorize to get called whenever a user hits "Submit!"

Give the <form></form> an onSubmit attribute. Set the attribute's value equal to the authorize function.*/
