<!-- Creating HTML Elements
Dynamically adding elements to our HTML page is a powerful toolâ€”it lets us modify not only the formatting, but the actual structure of our websites in response to a user's actions. For example, when you get a Gchat, each message is actually a new <div> being dynamically added to the page. Cool, right?

If you think about it, we've sort of done this already: all we're doing is setting a variable equal to a jQuery object. In this case, however, instead of just having something like:

$p = $('p');
We'll want to pass in an entire HTML element in quotes:

$p = $("<p>I'm a new paragraph!</p>");
When we put text in quotes like this, we call it a string (as in a "string of characters"). From now on, when we say "string," you can think "text" or "phrase." Strings are always in single or double quotes.

Instructions
In script.js, create a variable, $h1, and set it equal to a jQuery object containing an <h1> tag with the text "Hello". The tag should be a string. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
		<title>Result</title>
        <script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'>
        $h1 = $('<h1>Hello</h1>');
        </script>
	</head>
	<body></body>
</html>
