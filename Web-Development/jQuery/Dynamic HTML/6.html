<!-- Adding and Removing Classes
We don't have to limit ourselves to adding or removing entire elements, thoughâ€”we can fine-tune our jQuery superpowers to alter classes, CSS, and even the contents of our HTML elements.

Let's start with classes. jQuery includes two functions, .addClass() and .removeClass(), that can be used to add or remove a class from an element. This is great if, for example, you have a highlighted class that you want to apply to an element when clicked.

The syntax looks like this:

$('selector').addClass('className');
$('selector').removeClass('className');
where 'selector' is the HTML element you want and 'className' is the class name you want to add or remove.

Remember: You aren't selecting anything, you are modifying your element. This means that you do not need # or . before your class.

Instructions
Now that we think of it, that highlighted class seems like a great idea. We've supplied the HTML and CSS; in the script.js tab, add the jQuery code necessary to make your #text div highlighted when clicked!

MAKE SURE to click "Submit," and THEN click "Highlight me, too!" to see the results. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
		<title>Highlights</title>
        <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='6.css'/>
        <script type='text/javascript' src='6.js'></script>
	</head>
	<body>
        <div id="title" class="highlighted">I'm highlighted!</div>
        <div id="text">Highlight me, too!</div>
	</body>
</html>
