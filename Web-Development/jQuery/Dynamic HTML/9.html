<!-- Modifying Content
Finally, we can update the contents of our HTML elements—that is, the bit between the opening and closing tags—using the .html() and .val() functions.

.html() can be used to set the contents of the first element match it finds. For instance,

$('div').html();
will get the HTML contents of the first div it finds, and

$('div').html("I love jQuery!");
will set the contents of the first div it finds to "I love jQuery!"

.val() is used to get the value of form elements. For example,

$('input:checkbox:checked').val();
would get the value of the first checked checkbox that jQuery finds.

Instructions
We've added a paragraph to our HTML document. Use the .html() function to set its text to "jQuery magic in action!" (Don't forget the exclamation point!) -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Result</title>
        <script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'>
        $(document).ready(function() {
    $("p").html("jQuery magic in action!");
})
        </script>
	</head>
	<body>
        <p>I'm about to change!</p>   
	</body>
</html>
