<!-- Let's .focus()!
Another event we can make use of is .focus(). We say an element has focus when we click on it or tab over to it. If you've ever filled out a form on a web page and seen how each text box lights up when you tab to it or click on it, you've seen focus in action!

The .focus() event handler only works on elements that can receive focusâ€”the list of these elements is a bit vague, but HTML elements like <textarea>s and <input>s are the usual suspects.

Check out the form we've set up in the Result tab. If you click on the input field, you'll see it automatically highlights in a delightful baby blue. Too bad baby blue is for babies! We want our highlighting to be red.

We can do this with two tools: .focus() and our .css() function from the last section. We want to write a bit of jQuery code that will change our 'input''s 'outline-color' to 'red' when it gains focus.

Instructions
In script.js, get your document .ready(). Do two things:

Turn 'input' into a jQuery element and call the .focus() event handler on it.
Inside your event handler function, call .css() on your 'input' element and pass it two inputs: the CSS element to change ('outline-color') and the color to change it to ('#FF0000').
Not all browsers have equal CSS implementation. So for this lesson, if you are using Firefox, you will need to first change the outline-style to solid. -->
