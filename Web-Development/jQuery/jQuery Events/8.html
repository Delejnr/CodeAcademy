<!-- The .keydown() Event
You're not limited to mouse events in jQueryâ€”you can trigger events using the keyboard, as well!

The .keydown() event is triggered whenever a key on the keyboard is pressed. It only works on whatever page element has focus, so you'll need to click on the window containing your div before pressing a key in order for you to see its effects.

Let's go ahead and combine our new event with a new effect: .animate()! We'll use this to move an object on the screen whenever we press a key.

The .animate() effect takes two inputs: the animation to perform, and the time in which to perform the animation. Here's an example:

$(document).ready(function() {
   $('div').animate({left:'+=10px'},500);
});
This will take the first div it finds and move it ten pixels to the right. Remember, increasing the distance from the left margin moves something to the right; the += bit is just a shorthand for "take the existing number and add ten to it." In this case, it add ten pixels to the current distance from the left margin.

Instructions
After setting up with $(document).ready(), call the .keydown() event on $(document). (We want the whole document object to respond whenever a key is pressed.)

Inside your .keydown() handler, .animate() your 'div' with the same inputs as above: {left:'+=10px'} and 500. -->
