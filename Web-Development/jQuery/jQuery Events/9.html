<!-- Getting Ready
Now that you've got a solid foundation in jQuery events and have covered important functions like .keydown() and .animate(), we'll put our newfound knowledge to work. In this section, we'll animate a sprite, or two-dimensional image on the screen.

For this momentous event, we've chosen a familiar face. Check him out in the Result tab!

Instructions
Let's get started. First, get your document .ready(). -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
		<title>Super Mario!</title>
        
        <style type="text/css">

	        img {
			    position: relative;
			}
		</style>
		<script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'></script>
	</head>
	<body>
        <img src="http://i1061.photobucket.com/albums/t480/ericqweinstein/mario.jpg"/>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- Using .keydown()
Good! Now we want to add a line of jQuery that will handle the keydown event.

Instructions
Inside your $(document).ready() setup, call the .keydown() event on $(document). Pass .keydown() a function(){} as an input. Here's the twist: your function should take a single input, key, which will help jQuery figure out which key was pressed. -->

<!-- $(document).ready(function() {

    $(document).keydown(function(key) {});
}); -->
