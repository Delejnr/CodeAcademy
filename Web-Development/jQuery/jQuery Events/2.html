<!-- Cutting to the Chase
Let's quickly review how to trigger an effect without a special event handler like .click()â€”we just want our effect to happen as soon as our document is .ready().

Remember: practice makes perfect!

Instructions
Your div represents the planet Krypton. Make it .fadeOut() 'fast'! (Go ahead and do this immediately, without the need for a click.) -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Kapow!</title>
        <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='2.css'/>
        <script type='text/javascript'>
        	$(document).ready(function(){
			    $("div").fadeOut("fast");
			});
        </script>
	</head>
	<body>
        <div></div>   
	</body>
