<!-- jQuery UI, is There Anything You Can't Do?
All right! Time to use jQuery UI to create that awesome-looking accordion-style dropdown menu we saw in the last section. For this, we'll be using jQuery UI's built-in .accordion() function. (Handy, no?)

First, however, we'll need some additional HTML elements.

Instructions
We got you started in the index.html tab, but a menu's no good with only one section! Add two more like the first one. They should go inside the '#menu' div but after the "Section 1" div. -->
