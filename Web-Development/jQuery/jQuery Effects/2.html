<!-- More Practice with .animate()
Let's get in a little more practice with the .animate() effect. That's the one with the slightly more complicated inputâ€”if we wanted to move a div 10 pixels down, we'd type something like

$('div').animate({top:'+=10px'},500);
Where the bit between curly braces says "hey, jQuery! Add 10 pixels to the current top margin," and the second input says "do it in 500 milliseconds!" (1,000 milliseconds = one second.)

Instructions
Going down? 
1. Let's begin begin by targeting our image inside $()
2. Then let's animate our image to go down by 100px
3. Let's make it happen in 1 second or 1000 milliseconds -->
