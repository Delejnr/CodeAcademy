<!-- .slide()
We can also make Krypton .slide() into view. Not surprisingly, we do this by calling the .effect() effect and passing in 'slide' as an input.

If you want to see everything jQuery UI can do, you can check out the documentation here!

Instructions
Go ahead and change your 'bounce' to a 'slide', and remove the other two inputs. -->

$(document).ready(function() {
    $("div").click(function(){
        $(this).effect("slide");
    });
});
