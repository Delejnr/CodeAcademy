<!-- $p vs $('p')
You probably noticed that we used both $ and $() in the last exercise:

var $p = $('p');
There's a subtle difference between the two.

$p is just a variable name. There is no magic associated with the $ in $p; it's just a convention for saying, "hey, this variable contains a jQuery object." We could call $p anything we want: $paragraph, paragraph, space_cows, whatever! It's just helpful for people reading our code to see $p, since this is a concise way of saying "hey, there's a 'p' jQuery object in here."

$(), on the other hand, is magic. This is the function in disguise that creates jQuery objects. If you're making a jQuery object, you gotta use it!

Instructions
Remember when we told you to ignore the paragraph = in the last lesson? Well, now you know what it does! (You also know that it should have been $p.)

Create a variable $div, and assign it to a div jQuery object using =. No need to use $(document).ready() or any additional code! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
        <script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'>
        // Write your jQuery code below!

   $div = $('div');
    

        </script>
	</head>
	<body>
        <div></div>   
	</body>
</html>
