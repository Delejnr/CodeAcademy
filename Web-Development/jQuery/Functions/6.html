<!-- Selecting by Class
We don't have to limit ourselves to selecting HTML elements like <p> and <div>; essentially, we can put any CSS selector in quotes and pass it into $(). This means we can select classes, too!

Recall that we can select classes in CSS by using a dot (.). If we have class="red" in our HTML, we can target it in CSS with .red. In jQuery, all we need to do is put '.red' in quotes, and we can pass it to $() to make a jQuery object.

Instructions
Let's get some practice with the .click() action.

Finish the jQuery code so that it will make all four divs of class '.vanish' fadeOut() 'slow'ly when the button is .click()ed. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Vanishing Act</title>
		<style type="text/css">
		.vanish {
		    height: 100px;
		    width: 100px;
		    display: inline-block;
		    background-color: #F38630;
		    border-radius: 5px;
		}
		</style>
        <script type='text/javascript'>
        $(document).ready(function() {
		    $('button').click(function() {
		        $('.vanish').fadeOut('slow');
		    });
		});
        </script>
