<!-- Selecting by ID
If we can select by class, it follows that we can also select by ID. We do this by putting the ID name (in quotes) inside $(). Just as we need the . for classes, we need the # for IDs. We could target id="header" like so:

$('#header');
The semicolon at the end is importantâ€”it's how jQuery knows we're done giving it a command. For now, a good rule of thumb is that you should put semicolons at the end of any line that does not end with an open {. (The editor will try to help you out with your semicolon placement, so pay attention to its warnings.) Examples of correct and incorrect semicolon use are in the Hint.

Instructions
Update your jQuery code so that it only .fadeOut()s the div with the ID #blue. -->
