<!-- Using Functions to Select HTML Elements
Now that you know more about how functions work, you understand that when we have something like

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('div').hide();
});
we're passing .ready() a function (which itself takes no inputs; that's why its () are empty) and that function's job is to .hide() the div jQuery object.

Instructions
Give .ready() a function(){} as an input. Inside your function's {}s, call fadeIn('slow') on the (currently invisible) div to bring it into view. That's right, there's a fade in, as well! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
		<title>Fade In!</title>
		<style type="text/css">
		div {
		    height: 100px;
		    width: 100px;
		    background-color: #F38630;
		    display: none;
		    border-radius: 5px;
		}
		</style>
        <script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'>
        $(document).ready(function() {
			$('div').fadeIn('slow');
		});
		
        </script>
	</head>
	<body>
        <div></div>   
	</body>
