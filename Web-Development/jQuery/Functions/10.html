<!-- All right! Time to use our new jQuery knowledge to add another interactive component to our website: a sliding panel that moves up and down when clicked.

We've set up the necessary HTML and CSS for you. Your assignment: animate it with jQuery.

Instructions
You know the drill! Turn document into a jQuery object and call the .ready() action. (No need to put anything in .ready()'s parentheses just yet.) -->


<!-- Toggling Our Panel
Perfect! Just one more step: we need to tell .click() what to do. In this case, when our pull tab is clicked, we want our sliding panel (with the class .panel) to open or close.

The jQuery event we need to toggle our sliding panel is (you guessed it): .slideToggle()! We'll pass it one input, which is the speed of our slide animation.

Instructions
Inside .click()'s parentheses, create a .panel jQuery object and call the .slideToggle() effect. Give it the input 'slow' for the animation speed. -->
