<!-- Getting Started
Next, we'll need to start up our jQuery magic using the $(document).ready(); syntax you've seen. It works like this:

$() says, "hey, jQuery things are about to happen!"
Putting document between the parentheses tells us that we're about to work our magic on the HTML document itself.
.ready(); is a function, or basic action, in jQuery. It says "hey, I'm going to do stuff as soon as the HTML document is ready!"
Whatever goes in .ready()'s parentheses is the jQuery event that occurs as soon as the HTML document is ready.
So,

$(document).ready(something);
says: "when the HTML document is ready, do something!" (We'll show you how to replace something with an action in the next exercise.)

Note that .ready(); ends with a semicolon. This tells jQuery that you're done giving it a command.

Instructions
Add a $(document).ready(); call in script.js. Remember, the document is special: it's not an HTML element like <p> or <div>, so it doesn't go in quotes. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <!--Add your script tag here.-->
       <script type="text/javascript">
       $(document).ready(function(){


});
       </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div></div>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- The Functional Approach
Perfect! Now we need to put something inside our ready() function.

Remember, when we say "function," you can think "action." Functions are the basic unit of doing work in jQuery.

For this reason, jQuery includes a function keyword. The syntax looks like this:

function(){
    jQuery magic;
}
If we add our function inside our .ready(), jQuery will run the code in our function as soon as the HTML document loads. The syntax would then look like this:

$(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery magic;
});
Remember, we end our jQuery statements with a semicolon.

Instructions
Place a function(){} inside your .ready(). You don't need to put anything inside your function's curly braces ({}) yetâ€”we'll get to that in the next exercise. -->
