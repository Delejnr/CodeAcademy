<!-- Electr(on)ic Slide
Almost there! Now we just need to include an action in the body of our function. In this case, we'll make a header div for our HTML page slide into view.

Between the {}s of our function(), we'll want to turn our div into a jQuery object so jQuery can manipulate it. Much like we use .ready() on $(document), we'll use the .slideDown() action on our div jQuery object.

Inside .slideDown's parentheses, we'll want to tell it how quickly to slide down. Let's enter 'slow' (include the quotes).

Instructions
On line 2 in script.js, make 'div' into a jQuery object and call the .slideDown() action on it. Inside slideDown()'s parentheses, type 'slow' so jQuery knows how quickly to slide your div down. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <!--Add your script tag here.-->
       <script type="text/javascript">
       		$(document).ready(function(){
$('div').slideDown('slow');

});
       </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div></div>
    </body>
</html>
