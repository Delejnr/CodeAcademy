Great! Next, let's include our function keyword and two new actions together, mouseenter() and fadeTo().

mouseenter() does what you might expect: it produces a change when your mouse enters a given HTML element. For example,

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('div').mouseenter(function() {
        $('div').hide();
    });
});
would hide every <div> on the page as soon as you mouse over one. (We'll find out how to affect just one <div> among many in the next lesson.) For now, we only have one <div>, so this setup is okay.

Instead of hide(), however, we'll place fadeTo() inside mouseenter(). fadeTo() takes two arguments, or inputs, between its parentheses, separated by a comma: the speed at which to fade, and the opacity (or transparency) to fade to. For example,

fadeTo('fast', 0.25);
would quickly fade the target element to 25% of its original opacity, making it very light-colored.

Instructions
Using the examples above, make it so your 'div' fades to 1 (100%) opacity when your mouse enters the 'div'. Make the animation speed 'fast'. (Make sure to give fadeTo() its inputs in orderâ€”speed, then opacity.)

Click Save & Submit Code, then slowly mouse over your 'div' to see the effect! -->
