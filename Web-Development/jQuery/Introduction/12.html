<!-- ...and Get Yourself Out!
Excellent! Your button looks great nowâ€”it stands out when the user mouses over it.

However, you'll notice that when you take your cursor off the button, it stays dark. What we really want is for our button to become light again when our mouse leaves.

You might have guessed that jQuery includes a mouseleave() action. If so, you're right! (If you're curious, you can learn more about these actions in the jQuery documentation.)

Instructions
Between the }); that ends your mouseenter() and the }); that ends your $(document).ready(), add a mouseleave() that uses fadeTo to return your div's opacity to 0.5. Like the previous fadeTo, it should have 'fast' as its first input.

Click Save & Submit Code, then slowly mouse over your 'div' to see the effect! -->
