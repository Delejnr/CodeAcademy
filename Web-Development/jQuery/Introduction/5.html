Linking Your HTML and JavaScript Files Great! Now we need to link our HTML page to our jQuery script so our jQuery magic will affect our HTML. Just like we need a
<link> tag to connect our HTML and CSS, we need a
<script>
    tag to connect our HTML and jQuery.The tag looks like this:

        < script type = "text/javascript"
    src = "script.js" >

</script>
Note that the
<script>
    tag is not self - closing;
    it requires a closing

</script> tag. Instructions Add a
<script>
    tag to index.html.Its type should be "text/javascript"
    and its src should be "script.js".
