<!-- The Document Object Model
To get the most out of jQuery, we should review how an HTML page is put together.

An HTML document is structured according to the Document Object Model, or DOM. It's by interacting with the DOM that jQuery is able to access and modify HTML.

The DOM consists of every element on the page, laid out in a hierarchical way that reflects the way the HTML document is ordered. Remember how we could think of the HTML document as a tree? You can think of the DOM the same way. Just as with an HTML document, elements in the DOM can have parents, children, and siblings.

If you're a little hazy on what an HTML element is, what a CSS selector is, or what IDs and classes are, feel free to review these in the HTML and CSS track.

Instructions
Check out the code in script.js. We'll explain the code more soon, but for now the main idea is that when the HTML document loads, the code will select an HTML element and make it disappear.

We'll want to target the div element here, so on line 2 inside the $( ), add "div". -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title></title>
    <style type="text/css">
        div {
            height: 100px;
            width: 100px;
            background-color: #FF0000;
            border-radius: 5px;
        }

    </style>
   <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('div').fadeOut(1000);
        });

    </script>


</head>

<body>
    <div></div>
</body>

</html>
