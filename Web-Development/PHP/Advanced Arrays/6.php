<!-- Multidimensional Arrays
Not only can you store integers and strings in arrays, you can also store... other arrays! This is called a multidimensional array.

How do we do this? Well, just like a normal array with comma-separated values, but you would put comma-separated arrays insteadâ€”just like the code in the editor.

$deck is an array which contains 3 rows, each being a playing card. Within each row, it has the name of the card, along with the value.

To retrieve a card, we would first get the row for that card, then get the value we require (either to display the card, or calculate the player's total).

If we access $deck[2], we would get the third row (remember, arrays start from 0 in PHP!)

That will return another array containing 2 values: the first (0) which is a string that has the value "7 of Diamonds", and the second (1) which is an integer that has the value 7.

If we want the "7 of Diamonds" string, we would simply use $deck[2][0];.

Simple!

Instructions
Try adding another card to the array. It can have whatever rank, suit, and value you like, but keep in mind the value should be a number! -->

      // Imagine the first chosen card was the 7 of Diamonds.
      // This is how we would show the user what they have:
      echo 'You have the ' . $deck[2][0] . '!';
