<!-- Creating a Variable
Practice makes perfect! Let's get started by creating a variable and giving it a value.

Instructions
Declare a variable, $myName, and give it your name as a string. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='style.css'/>
		<title>PHP FTW!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
        <!-- Write your PHP code below!-->
        <p>
        $myName = "Manish Giri";
            
        </p>   
	</body>
</html>

<!-- Let the Machine Do the Math
Remember, computers were built to do the stuff we don't want to! And that includes doing tedious computations.

Instructions
After your first variable, declare a second, $myAge, and set it equal to your age as a number. Remember: no quotes around numbers! -->
