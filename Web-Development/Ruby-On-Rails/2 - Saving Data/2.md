Great! You created a new Rails app named MessengerApp.

Looking at the request/response cycle, we need four parts to build a Rails app - a model, a route, a controller, and a view.

Let's start here by creating a model.
1.
In the terminal, generate a new model named Message

rails generate model Message

2.
Open the migration file in db/migrate/ for the messages table. The name of the migration file starts with the timestamp of when it was created. Inside the change method, add this line as line 4:

t.text :content

3.
Then in the terminal, run

rake db:migrate

4.
Finally, run

rake db:seed
