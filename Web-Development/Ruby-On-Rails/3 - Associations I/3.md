Nice work. What did we just do?

We added two string columns title and image to the tags table
We added three string columns name, image, and description to the destinations table
We also added the line t.references :tag to the destinations table. This adds a foreign key pointing to the tags table.
Finally we ran the migrations to update the database, and seeded the database with the data in db/seeds.rb.

1.
Now that the models are set up, let's move on to the rest of the request/response cycle and create a controller, a route, and a view.

Generate a controller named Tags

$ rails generate controller Tags

2.
In the routes file, add a new route that maps requests to /tags to the Tags controller's index action.

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "tags" => "tags#index"

  3.
  Then in the Tags controller, add the index action to display a list of all tags. To do this, fetch all tags from the database and store them in variable @tags.
class TagsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @tags = Tag.all
  end
end


4.
In app/views/tags/index.html.erb at line 12, iterate through each tag in the @tags array. Then for each tag, display its title and image.

We've provided CSS in app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.

# index.html.erb

<div class="header">
  <div class="container">
    <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/learn-rails/img/logo-1tm.svg" width="80">
    <h1>BokenjiKan</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="tags">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="cards row">
    
      <%@tags.each do |tag| %>
      <div class="card col-xs-4">
        <%=tag.image%>
        <h2> <%= tag.title%> </h2>
      </div>
      <%end%>
      

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
