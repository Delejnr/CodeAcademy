We built a Rails app that stores data using a single model.

What if we want to build an app with more than one kind of data, like Team and Athlete? Both Team and Athlete would have have different columns, and it would get messy to represent both in one model. Instead, we can represent them using two models.

Let's see how this works by building a Rails app for a travel app.
1.
Create a new app named TravelApp.
2.
Install the gems.
3.
Run the local server and visit http://localhost:8000.
