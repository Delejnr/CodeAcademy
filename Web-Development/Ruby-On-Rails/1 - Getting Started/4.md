Great! We created a new controller named Pages. How did we do this?

The rails generate controller Pages command generated a new controller named Pages. This created a file named app/controllers/pages_controller.rb.
Inside the new Pages controller, we added a method called home. Methods in Rails controllers are also referred to as controller actions, so here we added the home action to the Pages controller.

Now that we have a controller, let's move on to the second part of the request/response cycle and create a route.

Open config/routes.rb and underneath line 1, type:

get 'welcome' => 'pages#home'
