Congratulations! You built a Rails app from scratch. What can we generalize so far?

Using the request/response cycle as a guide, this has been our workflow when making a Rails app.

Generate a new Rails app.
Generate a controller and add an action.
Create a route that maps a URL to the controller action.
Create a view with HTML and CSS.
Run the local web server and preview the app in the browser.
