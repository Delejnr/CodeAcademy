# Looping with 'Until'
# Good work!

# i = 3
# while i > 0 do
#   print i
#   i -= 1
# end

# j = 3
# until j == 0 do
#   print j
#   j -= 1
# end
# In the example above, we wrote the same loop using while and using until.

# Instructions
# Now rewrite your while loop using until.

# You still want to print out the numbers 1 through 50, inclusive.

i = 1
until i > 50 do
    print i
    i += 1
end
