# # Getting the User's Input
# # First things first: we'll need to get the user's input.

# # Instructions
# # Use puts to prompt the user for input two times. For the first puts, declare a variable called text and set it equal to the user's input via gets.chomp. For the second puts, declare a variable called redact and set it equal to the user's input using gets.chomp.
puts "Enter text to search through"
text = gets.chomp
puts "Enter word to redact"
redact = gets.chomp
