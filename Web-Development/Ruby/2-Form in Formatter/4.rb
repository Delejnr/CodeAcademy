# Repeat for More Input
# All right! Now we need to repeat what we've done for last_name, city, and state.

# Instructions
# Add print prompts, variables, and gets.chomps for the user's last name, city, and state/province. Use last_name as the variable for the user's last name, city for their city, and state for their state or province. (Hint: prompt the user to provide an abbreviation for their state or province, such as "NY" for New York. This will naturally lead us to use .upcase later!)


print "What's your first name?"

first_name = gets.chomp

print "What's your last name?"
last_name = gets.chomp

print "What's your city?"
city = gets.chomp

print "What's your state(Enter abbreviation)?"
state = gets.chomp
