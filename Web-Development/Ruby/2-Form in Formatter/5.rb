# Printing the Output
# As you might have noticed, Ruby's not really returning any feedback to us. We want to be able to see our string formatting in action! For this, we'll need one more new piece of syntax.

# If you define a variable monkey that's equal to the string "Curious George", and then you have a string that says "I took #{monkey} to the zoo", Ruby will do something called string interpolation and replace the #{monkey} bit with the value of monkeyâ€”that is, it will print "I took Curious George to the zoo". We can do the same thing here! For example:

# first_name = "Kevin"
# puts "Your name is #{first_name}!"
# will print "Your name is Kevin!"

# Instructions
# Let's use this syntax to print out the values of first_name, last_name, city, and state using #{} syntax.


print "What's your first name?"

first_name = gets.chomp

print "What's your last name?"
last_name = gets.chomp

print "What's your city?"
city = gets.chomp

print "What's your state(Enter abbreviation)?"
state = gets.chomp

puts "Your name is #{first_name} #{last_name},and you are from #{city}, #{state}!"
