# If, Else, and Elsif
# All right! You're all on your lonesome. (Well, not quite. We'll just leave this example here.)

# a = 10
# b = 11
# if a < b
#   print "a is less than b!"
# elsif b < a
#   print "b is less than a!"
# else
#   print "b is equal to a!"
# end
# Instructions
# Create an if/else statement in the editor. Make sure to include at least one elsif. Each branch of the statement should print something to the console.

a = 20
b = 30

if a < b
    print "df"
elsif b < a
    print "sf"
else
    print "ss"
