# Using two lists as two arguments in a function
# Using multiple lists in a function is no different from just using multiple arguments in a function!

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [4, 5, 6]
# print a + b
# # prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# The example above is just a reminder of how to concatenate two lists.

m = [1, 2, 3]
n = [4, 5, 6]

# Add your code here!
def join_lists(x,y):
    return x + y




print join_lists(m, n)
# You want this to print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
